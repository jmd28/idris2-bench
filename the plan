current priority: 
benchmark suite
otherwise cant tell whether or not optimisations did anything

see nofib

immediate todo: make sort tests take longer
                - large random string file?
                - repeat the sort?


idris2 benchmark suite
- [?] mergesort
- [ ] treesort
- [x] triples
- [x] words 
- [?] sort "strings"
- [ ] csv parser read/write

## optimisation
try inlining newRef - otherwise is a macro big think job
can macro other common functions a bit more easily

check out mimalloc to see if performance increase significant

batch reference management when many created in succession,
remove ref man when reference dropped immediately
