current priority: 
benchmark suite
otherwise cant tell whether or not optimisations did anything

see nofib

immediate todo: make sort tests take longer
                - large random string file?
                - then find the last element
                - repeat the sort 100 times
                -- still need to do this on mergeStr


idris2 benchmark suite
- [?] mergesort
- [ ] treesort
- [x] triples
- [x] words 
- [?] sort "strings"
- [ ] csv parser read/write
- take sorted dictionary shuffle sort check out = input

## optimisation
try inlining newRef - otherwise is a macro big think job
can macro other common functions a bit more easily

check out mimalloc to see if performance increase significant

batch reference management when many created in succession,
remove ref man when reference dropped immediately


linear congruence generator
x' = mx + c
(use to generate list to sort)
